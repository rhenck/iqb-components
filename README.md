# IqbComponents

This is a library of recurrent components in Angular-Projects of the IQB. 

## How to use

```
npm install iqb-components
```

## for developers

### Show Case App for Development

This contains a showcase App for developers to try out each component and also for the automated tests. 

#### Installation and Deployment

```
git clone https://github.com/iqb-berlin/iqb-components.git
npm install
ng serve
```

#### Testing

##### E2E-Tests with Protractor
```
ng e2e
```

###### Troubleshooting
* e2e test fails because version of chrome mismatches chrome driver version 
```
npx webdriver-manager clean
npx webdriver-manager update --versions.chrome=`chromium --product-version` # replace "chrome" with "google-chrome" if you use that
ng e2e --webdriver-update=false
```

##### Unit Tests with Karma
```
ng test  
```

###### Troubleshooting
* If no browser could be caught run
```
export CHROME_BIN=/bin/chromium #this is an example. you have to fill CHROME_BIN
```

#### Default Ports

* deployment: 4207
* e2e-tests: 4208

#### Minimum Requirements

* node v8
* chrome (tests are set up for for testing with chrome but could be done with firefox as well)

### How to include a new component

#### new component check list
